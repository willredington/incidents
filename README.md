Link to a Github repository with your commits as you originally made them. Do not squash them or just have a single commit.
There should be a README in the repo with the following section:
Steps to install and run your app. Assume the user will be on OSX but if you do not have access to OSX machine, provide needed steps to run your app on any other OS.
What improvements would you make or best practices would you utilize if you had double the time?
About how much time did you spend on the project?
If you completed the project, add a few screenshots to the repo that show the working version as running on your machine.

# Improvements
* better clustering of pins on the map depending on how they are co-located
* some with a better eye for design to go over the UI/UX flow
* better styling for the file upload button
* weather at time of incident 

Time spent: 4.5 hours

Note: readme was updated after submission
